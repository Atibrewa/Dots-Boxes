# Dots and Boxes

 We intend to implement the classic dots and boxes game, where two players will go 1 vs 1. The main objective of this game is to fill up as many boxes as possible. Starting with an empty grid of dots, players take turns adding a single line between two unjoined adjacent dots, either vertically or horizontally. 
 
 To fill a box, you must draw lines adjacent to 1 line you have previously picked. You keep doing this every turn until you have joined the 4 sides that form the box. If a player draws a line that completes a box, then the player earns points and the box fills up with that playerâ€™s color of choice. 

 Our project consists of 5 different classes: GameManager.java , which is the main class and calls the other classes, UI.java, which is used to store and implement the elements for the user interface, the Grid.java, which draws the boxes, edges, and vertices and checks for cycles in the graph, the graph.java class, which is used to implement the graph data structure,  and finally the player.java class, which stores key information about the players.
